Header-only C++20 library. The public CMake target is `dacoexec::dacoexec`. It has no third-party dependencies.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.29)
project(consumer LANGUAGES CXX)

find_package(dacoexec CONFIG REQUIRED)

add_executable(consumer main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(consumer PRIVATE dacoexec::dacoexec)
```

```cpp
#include <dacoexec/dacoexec.hpp>
```

Linking the target requires C++20. Consumers may compile as C++20 or any later standard.

## Install

```shell
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=20 \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS=OFF

cmake --build build
cmake --install build --prefix /tmp/dacoexec-install
```

The installed prefix contains `include/dacoexec/dacoexec.hpp` and `lib/cmake/dacoexec/` (or the platform `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR`). Pass that prefix as `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`.

## Use without installing

```cmake
add_subdirectory(path/to/dacoexec)
target_link_libraries(app PRIVATE dacoexec::dacoexec)
```

`FetchContent` works the same way. As a subproject, tests, installation, and developer tools stay off unless the parent turns them on. The embedded project does not change the parent's language mode or compiler flags.

## Build the tests

```shell
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=20 \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED=ON \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS=OFF \
  -Ddacoexec_BUILD_TESTS=ON

cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

A core-only configure (`-Ddacoexec_BUILD_TESTS=OFF`) does not download Catch2 or stdexec.

## Options

| Option | Standalone | Subproject | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dacoexec_BUILD_TESTS` | ON | OFF | Catch2 smoke tests and consumer fixtures |
| `dacoexec_BUILD_CLI` | OFF | OFF | Rejected until the production CLI exists |
| `dacoexec_BUILD_FUZZ_TESTS` | OFF | OFF | Rejected until codec fuzz targets exist |
| `dacoexec_BUILD_BENCHMARKS` | OFF | OFF | Rejected until benchmark targets exist |
| `dacoexec_INSTALL` | ON | OFF | Install rules for `dacoexec::dacoexec` |
| `dacoexec_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS` | ON | OFF | Internal targets only |
| `dacoexec_ENABLE_CLANG_TIDY` | OFF | OFF | Developer or CI opt-in |
| `dacoexec_ENABLE_CPPCHECK` | OFF | OFF | Developer or CI opt-in |
| `dacoexec_ENABLE_FORMATTING` | OFF | OFF | Download formatting targets |

Sanitizers are also off until requested (`dacoexec_ENABLE_SANITIZER_ADDRESS`, `dacoexec_ENABLE_SANITIZER_UNDEFINED`, and the other `dacoexec_ENABLE_SANITIZER_*` options). Warning and sanitizer flags stay on the internal `dacoexec_options` and `dacoexec_warnings` targets. They are not part of the installed package.

## Development

Nix shells:

| Command | Compiler |
| --- | --- |
| `nix develop` | Clang 22 |
| `nix develop .#clang` | Clang 22 |
| `nix develop .#gcc` | GCC 16 |
| `nix develop .#clang16` | Clang 16 with its libc++ |
| `nix develop .#gcc12` | GCC 12 |

The existing presets `unixlike-clang-debug`, `unixlike-clang-release`, `unixlike-gcc-debug`, `unixlike-gcc-release`, and the Windows MSVC and clang-cl presets configure a strict C++20 build with tests enabled. See [Building](README_building.md).
